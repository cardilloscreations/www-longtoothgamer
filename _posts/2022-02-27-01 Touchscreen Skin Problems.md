If you're having problems with touch input because of skin conditions, calluses, cuts, cracked skin, or even band-aids, these solutions are just what you need. I simulate a "Zombie Finger" so I can explain what's going on and then demonstrate a few ways to solve it. These solutions work with any capacitive touch displays such as: smartphones, tablets, ipads, surface, etc.
