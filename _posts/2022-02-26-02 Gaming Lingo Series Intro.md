If you're confused by some terms used in Gaming or Gaming Chat, this series will help you learn more. Whether you're new to gaming, or you've been around for a while but still have questions, I will define some of the most common terms, answer questions, and try to give some useful advice along the way.

I try to keep each episode relatively short, but I like to cover a few related terms each episode so I can provide more relevant topical information with more context.

If you have more questions or suggestions for new episodes, please COMMENT on this video and I'll try to respond. I also might use it as inspiration for another episode.

This is the intro video for my [Game Lingo Series Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYTW1X-dTQ4RXDsasjPU2HEM5BZ2s5cu4).
