# Notes on Vlog Posts

A collection of reminders when creating new posts.

## Reminders

- Copy and paste the full YouTube description for convenience.
- Remove the CHAPTERS block because that's only needed by YouTube.
- Add <> around links because I've enabled kramdown markdown processing.
- Be sure to use "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━" because that's used to mark the excerpt.
- Fix the excerpt section if needed (e.g., playlist links, etc).
- Use the `embed-responsive` classes for the YouTube `iframe`.


## Resources

- **/images/vlog/** - contains the post header image and I will name them after the post so they're consistent.
- **/assets/** - contains any additional images or resources that are being hosted and served for the post.
- **embedded** - most posts will also have a YouTube video embedded but will not be hosted here.


## Categories

The following categories are strict because I can't use the archive plugin on Jekyll pages.
See the [./_pages/categories] directory for more.

### Gaming
Posts that are about gaming (research, reviews, advice, etc).

### Computing
Posts that are about computing (desktops, laptops, etc) but not about gaming.

### Mobile
Posts that are about mobile computing and smartphones but not about gaming.

### Misc
Miscellaneous posts including general tech tips, etc.


## Tags

Tags are also strict because I can't use the archive plugin on Jekyll pages.
See the [./_pages/tags] directory for more.

I might add more as needed, but the idea is to help provide convenient access
to topics that might be tangential to the overall category.
