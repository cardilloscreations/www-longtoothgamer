Create custom image Texture Nodons in Game Builder Garage with a Seeeduino XIAO. Once you get setup, it's so easy and painless to unleash more creativity with your creations. Use it for: character skins, custom game objects, photo images, and more. It's also a great workaround to avoid Number and Text Nodon limits. All thanks to an inexpensive little device and some great contributions that came from the community (more details in the GitHub repo).
