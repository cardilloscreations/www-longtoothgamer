Hi, I'm Ray Cardillo, and I created Long Tooth Gamer to help everyday adults with gaming and tech tips. I particularly enjoy helping older adults overcome challenges with technology and gaming.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please add a COMMENT to this video and I'll definitely consider it if there is enough interest.
